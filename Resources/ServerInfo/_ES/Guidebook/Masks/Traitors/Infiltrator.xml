    # Infiltrator
    As an infiltrator, you're a critical member of the team with a kit meant for breaking and entering.
    Your cache contains an EMAG, C4, and a bag with a full set of chameleon clothes for quick disguise changes.

    Your EMAG can be used to open any airlock or locker, damaging them in the process and bolting open airlocks.
